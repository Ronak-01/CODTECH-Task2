Project Overview

BMI Calculator**

This project is a Python-based application that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. It provides a simple and interactive way for users to determine their BMI and understand their health category according to standard BMI classifications.

Key Features:
1. Dynamic Input**: Accepts user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters or centimeters).
2. Accurate BMI Calculation**: Computes BMI using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
   \]
3. Health Classification:
   - Underweight
   - Normal weight
   - Overweight
   - Obesity
4. User-Friendly Output: Displays BMI value along with the health category for easy interpretation.

Goals:
- To create a simple and accurate BMI calculator for personal use.
- To educate users about their BMI and its implications on health.
- To serve as an example of a beginner-friendly Python project.

How It Works:
1. The user provides their weight and height through the console or a GUI interface.
2. The application calculates the BMI using the given formula.
3. The resulting BMI and corresponding health category are displayed to the user.

Use Cases:
- Individuals tracking their health metrics.
- Developers looking for a beginner Python project to understand user input and calculations.
- Educational tools for teaching basic health concepts and Python programming.

Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For scripting and calculations.
- **Libraries**: `tkinter` (optional, for GUI), `argparse` (for command-line inputs), or just `input()` for simplicity.

Future Enhancements:
- Adding metric and imperial unit options for weight and height.
- Providing health tips based on the calculated BMI.
- Implementing a graphical user interface for better usability.
- Storing user data for tracking BMI changes over time.
